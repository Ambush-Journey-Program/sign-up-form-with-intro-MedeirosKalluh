## The Challenge

### Briefing

- Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- While you’re doing that we’ll create new `branches` for each new piece of your website, then send it to GitHub when the code is done, and open **Code Review.** The goal is to get used to the development cycle.
